# mavQ-task1
In this task, I created a JSON API Server using Node.js and Express.js, connected to a MySQL database. The API server supports GET and POST requests for managing Teacher and Course data. The entire stack, including the API server and database, is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and scale. The API server listens on port 8080, while the MySQL database is accessible on port 5000. The project includes a docker-compose.yaml file for orchestrating the containers. I documented the work, explaining the technologies used, and provided screenshots of the application running successfully.
